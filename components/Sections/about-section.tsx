                            Hello! My name is <span className="text-primary font-semibold">Joaquin</span>. I have a passion for creating innovative solutions and tackling complex problems.
                            My journey into web development began in 2023 when I enrolled in the <span className="font-medium">Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp</span> at Ironhack.
                            I discovered a deep enthusiasm for development and thoroughly enjoyed the learning process.

                            Recently, I earned my <span className="font-medium">AWS Solutions Architect Associate</span> certification.
